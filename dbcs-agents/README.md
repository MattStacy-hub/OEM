# Installing an OEM Agent on a DBCS Host in OCI - Including Individual PDBs 

## Introduction
You can monitor cloud resources by installing OEM agents on cloud hosts such as an Oracle DB System. This way you can take advantage of the chargeback plug-in feature in OEM and generate cost reports down to the PDB level.

## Objectives
* Install an OEM agent on an Oracle cloud database for monitoring purposes
* Discover targets within OEM console once agent is installed on DB System

### Outline
1. Adding Hostnames & Creating Auth. Keys
2. Configuring the OEM Instance
3. Creating a Named Credential (In OEM Console)
4. Open Firewall in DBCS instance to Allow Traffic Through Port 3872
5. Discovering Host Targets in the OEM Console

# Walkthrough

## 1. Add Hostnames & Create Auth. Keys
Add Hostnames (in both the OEM & DBCS instances)

Ssh into DBCS Instance
Create a new ssh key as oracle user

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
"/home/opc/newKey/newKeyName"
"/home/oracle/.ssh"
create directory, auth_keys file, add ssh key there
sudo su - oracle

Add public key to authorized_keys for the oracle user
Save private key to your computer

------------------------------------------------------
Create Auth. Keys

Add /etc/hosts
IP of OEM
Run hostname if on OEM instance to get name
<IP address>    emcc.marketplace.com
 
Sudo -su oracle
Create ssh key, add public to authorized keys for oracle user
  Make sure ssh key has oracle user at end
  Copy private key to own computer
Change to root user
Then go to /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  Open that file
  Search PubkeyAuthentication
    Uncomment pubkeyauthentication yes
  Search password authentication
    Uncomment yes line
  To lock in sshd_config changes
    Sudo service sshd restart
Create a new named credential on OEM console
  Paste private key
  Name doesnâ€™t matter
When adding target manually
  /home/oracle
